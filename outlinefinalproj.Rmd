# A discussion of the scientific hypotheses you will investigate.

# An analysis  

- addresses your scientific hypothesis, using model building techniques you have learned in this course, as well as other courses. 

- Model and data diagnostics for appropriateness are expected. Plots and tables are highly encouraged, where you need to include the interpretation for each plot/table.

# Conclusions and recommendations
- give your conclusions of your outlined hypotheses 
- based on your analysis such as 
- important variables identified, 
- the most appropriate model you have discovered,
- how statistical assumptions may be violated and how they affect your results, 
- difficulties faced when modelling and shortcomings of the current model, 
- interesting findings, etc..
